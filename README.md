## Overview

- View the project [here](#)
- Ecommerce site coded in React, MongoDB and Material UI.
- I wanted to focus on using **`useContext` and `useReducer`** hooks.
- Since my aims were to **use new hooks**, I didn't concentrate on styling.
- The reason why it's in Norwegian is because **each front end project I code, I like doing it in different languages.** ü§ì

## üí° Planning

- Creating a simple backend API in MongoDB and Express.js.
- I only made a stripped back product list.
- Making a `BasketContext` and `BasketProvider` which helped me pass props to different components.
- I had made my whole site with `useContext` functionality, but wanted to implement `useReducer` to try out the theory I had recently learnt.
- This meant that I had to refactor my `BasketContext` to link up with `useReducer`.
- After this was done, the logic felt **sooo much easier** when both were used together.
